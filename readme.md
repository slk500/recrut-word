Based on a projects size I have intentionally broken some of coding standards & PSR to make it simpler, smaller & easier to understand. Also we are 100% sure that project is finished and will be not developed any further. I took functional approach & focused on providing good set of tests.
I have gone well beyond you estimation of work 3-4h so I have taken some shortcuts:
      - frontend - css & colors are not 100% accuracy.
      - using ajax for such a simple task would be adding to much complexity & boilerplate code.
      - I havent add integration tests
      - using simple arrays not objects
      - put logic in view
      - database method saveWords should be multi insert for better performance
